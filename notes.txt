precedence of operators

 sizeof(char) = 1
 sizeof(short int) = 2
 sizeof(int) = 4
 sizeof(long int) = 8
 sizeof(float) = 4
 sizeof(double) = 8
 sizeof(long long int) = 8

if int was 1 byte,
then max positive int= (01111111)2 = 2^7 -1 = 127   // (-1) for 0
but int is 4 bytes, hence max pos. int = 2^31-1, unsigned int is from 0 to 2^32

float approximates to 6 decimals

for length, ++l or l++ give same output.

scanf("...") doesn't print nor edit output screen

in scanf for strings, no '&' i.e. scanf("%s",&str) is wrong, it should be just scanf("%s",str)
whereas for other types like int, scanf("%d",&a) is correct
because str itself is a pointer, so &str doesn't make sense


space breaks a string i.e. space can't be in a string.
scanf("%s") inputs a WORD. 
("%s%s") takes input 2 words which can be seperated by a space in user input.

gcc-GNU Compiler Collection

In gcc, to include header file should give link in compile command (lz: l-library, z-headerfile), e.g. to include math.h in basic.c: 
gcc basic.c -lm

An array of size n can be declared after n is taken user input.

Doubt: 
char s[]="ab";   sizeof(s)=3
char s[2]="ab";  sizeof(s)=2 -----what happened to size for null char?
